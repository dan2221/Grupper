* If some mod is not available to install, check if it has a "palettes/enemies" directory with ".pal" files inside.


WARNINGS:

* If you find some text files in the SORR subfolders, do not delete them, they are created by the program to identify mod installations;
* Do not delete the folder of an installed mod. Uninstall it first and then delete its folder;
* It's recommended that you don't change manually the files in the SORR folder and subfolders while a mod is installed;
* It's recommended that when you are going to replace Grupper to a new version, uninstall all mods and chars first.
